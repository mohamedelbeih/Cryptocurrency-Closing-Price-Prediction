This is a comprehensive dataset that captures the prices of a cryptocurrency along with the various features including social media attributes, trading attributes and time related attributes that were noted on an hourly basis during several months and that contribute directly or indirectly to the cryptocurrency volatile prices change.

A starter notebook is provided to help you make your first submission and land on the leaderboard.

Files available for download:

Train.csv - contains the target. This is the dataset that you will use to train your model.
Test.csv- resembles Train.csv but without the target-related columns. This is the dataset on which you will apply your model to.
SampleSubmission.csv - shows the submission format for this competition, with the ‘id’ column mirroring that of Test.csv and the close column containing your predictions. The order of the rows does not matter, but the names of the id must be correct.
